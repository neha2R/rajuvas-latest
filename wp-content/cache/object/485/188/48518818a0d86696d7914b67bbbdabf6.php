<p style="text-align: justify;">Milk is an important and most consumable livestock produce. It is a cost-efficient, nutritious source of protein, minerals and vitamins. The contamination of milk has become major issue of concern in last few years. A recent study by India's food safety regulator (the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India) reveals that 68.4% of milk samples examined are adulterated with various type of pollutants, most samples had been diluted with water, skimmed milk powder or sweeteners, detergent, hydrogen peroxide and even urea, some revealed even more unpleasant surprises. Further, there are several kinds of industrial waste, increasing number of vehicles discharge and heavy metals in the field, which are not easily biodegradable and consequently accumulated in soil, plant and animal system, ultimately reach to the food chain, and affect human health. Likewise, indiscriminate uses of antibiotics to the lactating animals, pesticides in the agricultural fields with poor enforcement of regulations are contributed to the prevalence of residues in milk.<img class=" size-medium wp-image-2237 alignright" src="http://rajuvas.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/MilkTesting1-300x201.jpg" alt="MilkTesting1" width="300" height="201" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Considering previously mentioned facts and concern of human health, University took lead for working in this direction by establishing ‚ÄúAdvanced Milk Testing Research Lab‚Äù as cutting edge technology lab at PGI-VER campus, Jaipur. The creation of state of art facility for analysis of various pollutants and adulterants in milk employing recent biotechnological tools for monitoring of various adulterants and environmental pollutants like heavy metals, antibiotic residues, pesticide residues and other common adulterants and investigation on milk of native breeds and value addition will go a long way for improving status of dairy enterprise in the state. Further, capacity building of farmers, dairy workers, various stake holders, members of co-operative societies, officers from dairy department, animal husbandry, medical health, food &amp; civil supplies and other line departments for milk quality and safety is also entrusted to this cutting edge laboratory.</p>
