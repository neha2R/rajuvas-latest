An advance animal nutrition laboratory has been established in Rajasthan University of Veterinary &amp; Animal Sciences, Bikaner with the objective to derive information on the composition of feed from which estimates of animal responses to dietary input can be made. Particularly forage crops vary widely in nitrogen, energy and mineral nutrient status and alone chemical analysis is not enough to ensure quality nutrient to animals for sustainable animal production. Further, poor nutrition is one of the major constraints to livestock productivity in the Rajasthan on account of the fact of thriving of animals predominantly on high fibre feeds deficient in many nutrients (nitrogen, energy, minerals etc.) essential for peculiar microbial digestion in ruminants. A complete picture of digestibility of farm animals is required to identify the constraints with particular feed and its mitigation so as to improve productivity.

The basic laboratories available in the state for the purpose though satisfactorily provide digestibility and chemical composition to describe the nutritive value of fibrous feeds but now in changing scenario this proved to be inadequate because these attributes alone give little indication of the quantity of feed on animal eat and the quality of nutrients that will ultimately be derived by farm animals through digestion. A complete understanding of feed in terms of nutrient availability and its utilization by animals is required to design diet that will be utilized most efficiently by animal for sustainable animal husbandry. Over and above this, the existing status of deficiency of feed and fodder in all terms i.e. roughage, green forage and concentrate have made utilization of NCFRs having anti nutritional factors inevitable for feeding of farm animals to bridge the gap <img class=" size-medium wp-image-1242 alignright" src="http://rajuvas.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rajuvas-feed-300x185.jpg" alt="rajuvas-feed" width="300" height="185" />between demand and availability of feed resources. However, inclusion of such feeds in the ration requires great care so that these factors present in feed may not act contrary to optimum nutrition or exert toxic effect. This in fact require support of an advance State-of-the-Art animal nutrition laboratory capable of analyzing all dimensions of feed both qualitatively and quantitatively and also can completely address the issue of their effects in animal. Considering all these facts, an advance animal nutrition laboratory for complete analysis of feed and fodder of animal and formulation of least cost economic balanced ration for animals for arriving at sustainable animal husbandry in the state has been established with Animal Nutrition Department of University. The laboratory is not only entrusted to generate innovative technologies but also to provide consultation to end users and develop package of practices in general and in specific to identified nutritional problems.";s:10:"post_title";s:22:"Feed & Fodder Analysis";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:4:"open";s:11:"ping_status";s:4:"open";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:20:"feed-fodder-analysis";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2015-04-15 11:15:38";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2015-04-15 11:15:38";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";i:0;s:4:"guid";s:42:"http://69.16.236.45/~rajuvas/?page_id=1129";s:10:"menu_order";i:0;s:9:"post_type";s:4:"page";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";s:6:"filter";s:3:"raw";}}
