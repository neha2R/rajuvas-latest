<p style="text-align: justify;">Hormones are highly active substances having profound effect on the physiology of the animal. Therapeutic use of hormones in veterinary science is well known. Many hormones are used for special clinical purposes, especially in diagnostic work. Radioimmunoassay is a highly sensitive technique to measure concentrations of hormone in the body fluids like serum or plasma. The precise measurement of minute concentration of hormone revolutionized the field of endocrinology. By allowing the accurate measurement of blood levels of hormones, the mechanism of hormone deficiency diseases can be identified and is then better treated.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Looking towards the usefulness of this technique in the veterinary science, a Radioimmunoassay Laboratory (RIA laboratory type-I) has been set up in the Department of Veterinary Physiology, CVAS, Bikaner. Presently the laboratory is engaged in profiling various hormones in disease and stress conditions in different species of animals for disease diagnosis and management of animals during stress. The Atomic Energy Regulatory Board, Govt, of India, Mumbai has approved the lay out plan from safety point of view for radioisotope laboratory in the Department of Veterinary Physiology, CVAS, RAJUVAS, Bikaner and two senior faculty members are trained at B ARC to work in radioisotope laboratory.</p>";s:10:"post_title";s:12:"Radioisotope";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:4:"open";s:11:"ping_status";s:4:"open";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:12:"radioisotope";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2015-10-18 19:27:26";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2015-10-18 13:57:26";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";i:0;s:4:"guid";s:42:"http://69.16.236.45/~rajuvas/?page_id=1137";s:10:"menu_order";i:0;s:9:"post_type";s:4:"page";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";s:6:"filter";s:3:"raw";}}
