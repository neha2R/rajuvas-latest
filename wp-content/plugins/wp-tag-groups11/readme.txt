== Description ==

Organize your WordPress tags in groups. Use highly customizable tag clouds (tabs, accordion or alphabet) in a post, page or widget.

= Finally, the end of messy tags =

Most websites mix up tags that should actually be separated by topics: places, people, brands, features, activities and more.

Your tags, however, will become much more useful if you organize them in groups. Imagine a tag cloud where all town names appear in a "Towns" group or where you keep all tags for product sizes under "Sizes" and all tags for colors under "Colors". The Tag Groups plugin lets you do exactly that.

With Tag Groups you can add a parent level to tags and make them hierarchical.

Tag Groups works also great with most other (flat) taxonomies, like WooCommerce product tags. Filters and bulk actions make your work with tags much easier, and you can even filter the list of posts in your backend by the groups that their tags belong to.

The plugin comes with two tag clouds where tags are sorted by groups and one alphabetical tag cloud where tags are sorted by first letters. These tag clouds can be customized with numerous parameters, and you can insert them as shortcodes into post, pages and widgets or as Gutenberg blocks.

= Possible applications =

* Display only specific tags in your tag cloud.
* Choose which tags to display in different sections of your blog.
* Change the sorting order in your tag cloud.
* Customize the links, the text, the font size or the separator of your tag cloud items.
* Prepend or append to each tag a custom character or the post count.
* Insert into each post a tag cloud using only the tags of this post.
* Easily manage huge amounts of tags or posts in the backend by dividing them into groups.
* Display your tags grouped by language or by topic.
* Create an alphabetical index of your tags - think of a phone book for your tags.

= Other Notes =

Styling created by jQuery UI who also provided the JavaScript that is used for the tabs to do their magic. Find their license in the package.

We are also using the SumoSelect JavaScript plugin.

== Installation ==

1. Find the plugin in the list at the backend and click to install it. Or, upload the ZIP file through the admin backend. Or, upload the unzipped tag-groups folder to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory.

2. Activate the plugin through the ???Plugins??? menu in WordPress.

The plugin will create a new menu "Tag Groups" and a submenu "Tag Group Admin" in the Post section (depending on the chosen taxonomy) where you find the tag groups. After you have created some groups, you can edit your tags (or other terms) and assign them to one of these groups. A filter and a bulk action menu are available on the Tags page and you also find a filter on the Posts pages.

The tabbed tag cloud (or an accordion containing the tags) can be inserted with a shortcode or a Gutenberg block. Options are listed under the "Tag Groups" main menu.

Extensive information, examples and help for troubleshooting are listed [here](https://chattymango.com/tag-groups/?pk_campaign=tg&pk_kwd=readme "plugin website").


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I show my tags sorted into groups on a page? =

Please use one of the shortcodes or Gutenberg blocks that come with the Tag Groups plugin. Since we cannot change the code of templates or other plugins, there is no possibility to make them aware of the new structure where tags are organized in groups.

= When I use the shortcode I can see the content but the tags are not displayed in tabs. =

Make sure you have "Use jQuery" checked on the settings page. If you use a plugin for caching pages, purge the cache and see if that helps. If you use plugins for minifying scripts or style sheets, turn them off and purge their caches.

= How can I use one of these tag clouds in a widget? =

Please use a text widget and insert the shortcode.

= Does this plugin support tags for pages? =

No. Although it might work (with additional 3rd-party plugins), it is not an officially supported feature.

= Does this plugin work with categories? =

No. Hierarchical taxonomies such as categories are not officially supported.

= I need the plugin for a very special purpose - can you help? =

Please check first if the [premium plugin](https://chattymango.com/tag-groups-premium/?pk_campaign=tg&pk_kwd=readme "Tag Groups Premium") can help. If not, you can ask for [support here](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/tag-groups).

= I am desperately missing my language. But, wait.. is this actually a "frequently asked question"? =

No, unfortunately it isn't. But, nevertheless, I'm glad you asked! You are warmly invited to [help us translate](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/tag-groups).
