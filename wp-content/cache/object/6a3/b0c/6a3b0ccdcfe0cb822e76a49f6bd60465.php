<p style="text-align: justify;">Rajasthan is exceedingly rich in its genetic resource biodiversity in terms of domestic and wild animals. There is an urgent need to conserve, protect and utilize them on a sustainable basis. Genetic resources are used to improve the agricultural and animal productivity and are the vital components of the global environment. Gene Bank concept has become very important, both for ex-situ conservation and for the utilization of the valuable germplasm on a long-term basis.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Bioinformatics is an emerging area offering a fundamental tool to the scientific community, particularly to the biologists, to speed up the research, application and information technology has completely transformed the research in the life sciences. The focus on genome technologies has made it still more relevant to establish very close linkages between computers and experimental biologists. There are many developments, for e.g. Enterprise Bioinformatics, High System Computing, Genomic Data and Data Base Integration and DN A Amplification and Sequencing, Genome Assembly and Gene types, Web based Bioinformatics, Biochips and Gene Expression Analysis and Proteomics and Mass Spectrometry which need be applied in the research and development in veterinary and animal sciences.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Chemo informatics i.e. application of computational skills in chemical science has interesting application in the field of drug designing and discovery. A comprehensive and integrated approach towards characterization of the full repertoire of molecular machines of the living systems incorporating molecular, chemical and informational dimensions is the need of the hour. Considering the importance of Bioinformatics and Chemo informatics, University has identified it as cutting-edge technology and started working on it with establishment of centre. The outcome of the centre as expected to be</p>

<ul>
	<li>Generating intensive data related to microbial and animal resources specially pertaining to genomics and proteomics.</li>
	<li>Analyzing system information which will be exceedingly useful in diagnosis and pinpointing genetic disorders as well as in establishing production related genomic systems aimed at enhancing animal products and solving health related problems.</li>
	<li>Bioinformatics tools will be useful in day-to-day research work.</li>
	<li>Intensification of knowledge based approaches among the scientists for molecular biological research.</li>
</ul>
